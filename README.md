Configs
=======

Configuration files for vim, tmux, bash, etc.

> cd  
> git clone https://github.com/smav/configs .dotfiles
> git clone https://github.com/smav/.vim .vim  
> ~/.dotfiles/bin/gitlinks.sh                  # start using the configs  

The gitlinks script will backup and replace(with links) the current configs.  

There are some general reference tips available:  
* bashtips
* sshtips
* vimtips
* tips

bashtips, sshtips, debtips, and vimtips are all due to be rolled into the more 
featureful tips command at some point

See https://github.com/smav/.vim for vim setup instructions.
